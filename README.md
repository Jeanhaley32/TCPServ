# theVoid
 Scream into the Void. A simple TCP server that reflects all received traffic to everyone connected.
 
 This is a god-awful rendition of Jean Serve. 
 - This gatheres messags from clients. 
 - passes messagse back to every other client
 - passes errors, and syslog to Terminal. 

I added something like 200+ more lines of code since trying to create this simple rendition.
